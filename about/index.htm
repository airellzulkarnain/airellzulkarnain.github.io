                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Airell Zulkarnain, I was born in Jakrata, October 27, 2005. i live in Banten province, district
                    Tangerang subdistrict kelapa dua. I've decided to go for a vocational high school, software engineering
                    major. my high school is quite far from where i lived, it took 30 minutes by motorcycle as long as there is
                    no traffic. I grew up as the technology grow too, I'd like to learn new things. Starting from Kindergarten,
                    i've already tried to disassembling my own playstation 2, to clean the dust out. while on Primary school i
                    oftenly tinkering my device e.g. root my phone and installing software on my pc, etc. Before I started dive
                    into programming world i thought that my passion is in design because i’d really like to draw and thinking
                    about taking multimedia major. while i was a second grader at SMPS Sunan Bonang Junior High School,
                    one of my classmate intruduce me to fake-hacking, using android app called Termux. On late first
                    semester, i decided to join the student council organization and having a lot of experience in there from
                    holding an event to discipline other students. On my last year, a virus called COVID - 19 spreading through
                    the world and causing a pandemic, National Examination have been removed and replaced with National
                    Based School Examination, we have to do the examination from our home till our graduation. From there, i
                    started to dive deeper and tried Python, i just copying some simple code from the internet without knowing
                    how it works. i tool a break for a while to prepare myself for my final exams, after that i started to learn
                    python language and write a couple of program on my own. Because of that, i put my interest in
                    technology even more, i dual booting linux on my laptop such as linux mint, ubuntu, kali linux, manjaro,
                    etc. i found myself getting comfortable with ubuntu, and use it as my main OS. Now I continue My study on
                    SMKN 5 Tangerang Software Engineering Major. At first i’m planning to join the student council
                    organization just like on my Junior High School, but i put interest to another organization called IT
                    Community, this organization devided into three classes and one of it is a programming class and i
                    decided to join the organization knowing there’s programming involved class in it. Now I’m being one of the
                    three programming mentor in this organization. A mentor in this organization is a person that given the role
                    to teach their juniors of their class.
