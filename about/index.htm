								Hello, I'm Airell Zulkarnain, I was born in Jakarta, October 27, 2005. I live in Banten province, Tangerang sub-district, Kelapa Dua sub-district. 
								I have decided to go to a vocational high school, majoring in software engineering. my high school is quite far from where I live, it takes 30 minutes by motorbike as long as there is no traffic. 
								I grow as technology develops too, I like to learn new things. Starting from kindergarten, I've tried to disassemble my own playstation 2, to clean the dust. 
								while in elementary school i used to fiddle with my device a lot eg. root my phone and install software on my pc etc. 
								Before I got into programming, I thought that my passion was in design because I really love to draw and thought about majoring in multimedia. 
								When I was in the 2nd grade of SMPS Sunan Bonang, one of my classmates asked me to do some fake hacking, using an android application called Termux. 
								At the end of the first semester, I decided to join the student council organization and had a lot of experience there from hosting events to disciplining other students. 
								In my last year, the virus called COVID - 19 spread all over the world and caused a pandemic, National Examination was removed and replaced with National Based School Examination, we had to do the exam from our home until passed. 
								From there, I started to dive deeper and try Python, I just copied some simple code from the internet without knowing how it works. 
								I took a short break to prepare myself for my final exam, after that I started learning python language and writing some programs myself. 
								Because of that, I am more and more interested in technology, I dual boot linux on my laptop like linux mint, ubuntu, kali linux, manjaro, etc. 
								I am comfortable with ubuntu, and use it as my main OS. Now I continue my studies at SMKN 5 Tangerang, majoring in Software Engineering. 
								Initially I planned to join student council organization like in my junior high school but I am interested in another organization called IT Community, 
								this organization is divided into three classes and one of them is programming class and I decided to join the organization knowing there is programming involved class in it. 
								I am now one of three programming mentors at this organization. Mentors in this organization are people who are assigned the role of teaching juniors.
